# 1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. Note: for this exercise, 
# the expectation is that you explicitly write out the year (and therefore be out of date the next year). 

def greeting() ->None:
  try:
    name: str = input("Please enter your name: ")
    age: int = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
  except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please try again.")

  current_date_time: int = datetime.now()

  year_100: int = year + years_left
  
  print(f"Hello! {name}, you will turn 100 in {year_100}")


# greeting()

# 2. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

def even_or_ood() -> None:
  try:
    num: int = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# 3. Take a list, say for example this one:
a: list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

# 7. Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

# 9. Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.

def guess_game() -> None:
  num: int = random.randint(1, 9)

b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

  overlap: list = [x for x in new_lis1 for y in new_lis2 if x == y]
  return overlap

# print(overlap2(a, b))

# 11. Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not.

def is_prime(num:list) -> bool:
  divisior_lis: list = [x for x in range(1, num+1) if num % x == 0]
  if len(divisior_lis) == 2:
    return True
  else:
    return False

# print(is_prime(4))

# 12. Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list.

p = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
