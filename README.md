    - Example: Input: `"I love Python"`, Output: `3`

14. **Sum of Digits**
    - Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number.
    - Example: Input: `123`, Output: `6`

15. **Multiplication Table**
    - Print the multiplication table of a given number.
    - Example: Input: `5`, Output: `5, 10, 15, 20...`

---

### **Advanced Beginner Problems**
16. **Find All Divisors**
    - Write a program to find all divisors of a number.
    - Example: Input: `12`, Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]`

17. **Check Palindrome (Number)**
    - Write a program to check if a number is a palindrome (reads the same backward).
    - Example: Input: `121`, Output: `True`

18. **Armstrong Number**
    - Write a program to check if a number is an Armstrong number.
    - (Armstrong number: Sum of its digits raised to the power of its length equals the number.)
    - Example: Input: `153`, Output: `True` (1Â³ + 5Â³ + 3Â³ = 153)

19. **Count Occurrences of an Element**
    - Write a program to count how many times a specific element appears in a list.
    - Example: Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, `Element: 2`, Output: `3`

20. **Generate a List of Squares**
    - Write a program to create a list containing the squares of numbers from 1 to `n`.
    - Example: Input: `n = 5`, Output: `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`
